#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Alisa Jung just finished her PhD with the computer graphics group at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Her thesis focused on getting the most out of a renderer under a given time constraint, with tools such as path guiding and regularization. Her research interests also include fluorescence and other spectral effects, materials and volumes. In 2023 she completed an internship with WētāFX working on path guiding and regularization in a production environment.
